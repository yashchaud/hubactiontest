# NumPy Compatibility Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

### Error in RunPod Logs:
```
AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.2.6
```

### Root Cause:
1. **TensorFlow 2.15** was compiled against NumPy 1.x API
2. Docker build installed NumPy 1.26.3 correctly
3. **But:** Later pip installs (librosa, keras-ocr, etc.) upgraded NumPy to 2.2.6
4. TensorFlow failed to import due to breaking API changes in NumPy 2.x

### Impact:
- ‚ùå **Text detection (Keras-OCR)** - DISABLED (depends on TensorFlow)
- ‚úÖ **NSFW detection (NudeNet)** - WORKING (line 251-252)
- ‚úÖ **Audio profanity** - WORKING (line 253-255)
- ‚úÖ **Object tracking** - WORKING (line 256)
- ‚úÖ **Blur applicator** - WORKING (line 257)
- ‚úÖ **HTTP service** - WORKING (health checks passing, sessions created)

---

## Fix Applied

### Changed File: [runpod-service/Dockerfile.optimized](runpod-service/Dockerfile.optimized:112)

Added after all pip installs:
```dockerfile
# CRITICAL FIX: Force downgrade NumPy to 1.x (TensorFlow incompatible with 2.x)
RUN pip3 install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir "numpy<2"
```

This ensures NumPy stays at 1.x even if other packages try to upgrade it.

### Git Commit:
```
commit 709b8f9
Fix: Force NumPy <2 for TensorFlow compatibility
```

## GitHub Actions Rebuild

### Status:
The fix has been pushed to GitHub. GitHub Actions will now:
1. Detect the new commit
2. Trigger Docker build workflow
3. Build new image with NumPy 1.x
4. Push to Docker registry
5. Take ~15-20 minutes

### Check Progress:
Visit: https://github.com/yashchaud/hubactiontest/actions

---

## What to Do Next

### Option 1: Wait for GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Wait ~15-20 minutes for build to complete
2. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/yashchaud/hubactiontest/actions
3. Once complete, pull new image to RunPod:
   ```bash
   docker pull your-registry/censorship-service:latest
   ```
4. Restart RunPod instance with new image
5. Verify with: `curl https://your-runpod-url/health`

### Option 2: Build Locally and Push
```bash
cd runpod-service
docker build -f Dockerfile.optimized -t your-registry/censorship-service:latest .
docker push your-registry/censorship-service:latest
```

### Option 3: Test Current Instance (Partial Functionality)
The current RunPod instance works with limitations:
- ‚úÖ NSFW detection active
- ‚úÖ Audio profanity detection active
- ‚ùå Text detection disabled

To test as-is:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Start as Broadcaster
3. Toggle censorship ON
4. Show NSFW content (will blur)
5. Speak profanity (will detect)
6. Show text with sensitive info (won't detect - text detection disabled)

---

## Verification Steps (After Rebuild)

### 1. Check RunPod Logs
Look for this line:
```
2025-10-02 XX:XX:XX,XXX - processors.text_detector - INFO - TextDetector initialized
```

**Should NOT see:**
```
ERROR - Error loading Keras-OCR: numpy.core.umath failed to import
WARNING - Text detection will be disabled
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-runpod-url/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T...",
  "models_loaded": {
    "text_detection": true,    // Should be true now!
    "nsfw_detection": true,
    "audio_profanity": true,
    "object_tracking": true
  },
  "gpu_available": true,
  "active_sessions": 0
}
```

### 3. Test End-to-End Censorship
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Start as Broadcaster with censorship ON
3. Test all detection types:
   - **Text:** Show paper with "SSN: 123-45-6789" ‚Üí Should blur
   - **NSFW:** Show inappropriate content ‚Üí Should blur
   - **Audio:** Speak profanity ‚Üí Should detect

## Technical Details

### Why This Happened

NumPy 2.0 was released in June 2024 with breaking changes:
- Removed `numpy.core._multiarray_umath` module
- Removed `_ARRAY_API` attribute
- Changed C-API structure

Packages compiled before NumPy 2.0 (like TensorFlow 2.15) are **incompatible** with NumPy 2.x.

### Long-Term Solution

Upgrade TensorFlow to a version that supports NumPy 2.x:
- TensorFlow 2.16+ has partial NumPy 2.x support
- TensorFlow 2.17+ has full NumPy 2.x support

**But:** Upgrading TensorFlow may break Keras-OCR compatibility.

**Current Fix is Stable:** Pinning NumPy <2 is the safest approach for production.

## Files Modified

1. **[runpod-service/Dockerfile.optimized](runpod-service/Dockerfile.optimized:112)** - Added NumPy constraint
2. **[server/services/processingBridge.js](server/services/processingBridge.js)** - Simplified (removed RTMP ingress complexity)
3. **[server/processors/contentCensorshipProcessor.js](server/processors/contentCensorshipProcessor.js:6)** - Added dotenv import
4. **[server/.env](server/.env:7)** - Removed trailing slash from RUNPOD_SERVICE_URL
5. **[client/src/Broadcaster.jsx](client/src/Broadcaster.jsx)** - Added censorship toggle UI

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working:
- Backend server (port 3001)
- Frontend client (port 3000)
- Censorship toggle UI
- RunPod service (partial - NSFW + audio only)
- Session creation
- Health checks

### ‚è≥ Pending:
- Docker image rebuild (~15-20 min)
- Text detection re-enable
- Full end-to-end censorship test

### ‚ùå Not Working (Yet):
- Text detection in current RunPod instance
- Complete censorship pipeline (missing text detection)

## Summary

**Issue:** NumPy 2.x incompatibility with TensorFlow 2.15
**Fix:** Force NumPy <2 in Dockerfile
**Status:** Fix committed, rebuilding via GitHub Actions
**Next:** Wait for build, redeploy to RunPod, test full pipeline

**ETA:** 15-20 minutes for rebuild + 5 min to redeploy = ~25 minutes total

**Updated:** October 2, 2025
**Status:** üîÑ Rebuilding
